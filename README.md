# battery-analysis
Matlab scripts to process lithium ion cell data for more manageable output/handling and analysis.

Cycling processors to get capacity vs. cycle (Ivium, Biologic).
Batch EIS analysis.
Mass spec.
XRD.
Cylindrical casing thickness.
THT ARC thermal runaway.
Some jellyroll orthoslice stuff.

Some scripts use MyPlotOptions to define plotting preferences. This isn't essential for functionality and can be revised/removed. I also typically set my plotting options at the start of functions; this is also not essential to dunctionality.

ZFit.m is required for EIS analysis, download from Mathworks.
